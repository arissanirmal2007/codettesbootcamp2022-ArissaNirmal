About me: 

 My name is Jia Nirmal. I am 14 years old and I go to the secondary school (MULO) in 

 the second grade.

 I come from a family of 5: my parents, my older sister, my younger sister and  

 me. I love to innovate! I got my interest in innovating from my uncle and my aunt.

 In my free time I work in  my garden, fishing, riding a bike or making puzzles.
